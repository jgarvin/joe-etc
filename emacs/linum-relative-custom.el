;;
;; linum-relative lets you display relative line numbers for current buffer.
;;

;;; Installation:

;; If you have `melpa` and `emacs24` installed, simply type:
;;
;;     M-x package-install linum-relative
;;
;; And add the following to your .emacs
;;
;;     (require 'linum-relative)

;;; Setup & Tips:

;; The non-interactive function *linum-on* (which should already be built into recent GNU Emacs distributions), turns on side-bar line numbering:
;;
;;     (linum-on)
;;
;; and alternatively, by enabling `linum-mode`:
;;
;;     M-x linum-mode
;;
;; Relative line numbering should already be enabled by default (by installing this package), following *linum-on* or enabling *linum-mode*. One can also use the *lineum-relative-toggle* interactive function to switch between relative and non-relative line numbering:
;;
;;     M-x linum-relative-toggle
;;

;;; Code:
