To use the client you either have to be root or be in the docker group
$ sudo usermod -aG docker username
You have to relogin for the group changed to take affect
$ sudo - username

Search for available images
$ docker search ubuntu

downloaded image without running it
$ docker pull ubuntu

list downloaded images
$ docker images

start up a container with a particular image and get a command prompt
$ docker run -it ubuntu

see active containers
$ docker ps

see active and inactive containers
$ docker ps -a

save changes you've made to the container to a dedicated image (Repository is usually docker hub username)
$ docker commit -m "What you did to the image" -a "Author Name" container_id repository/new_image_name

have docker log into docker hub, necessary before you can push images
$ docker login -u docker-registry-username

push a local image to the docker repository (Requires logging in first with above command)
$ docker push docker-registry-username/docker-image-name

build an image from a given docker file, give it a name, used the current directory for the context
$ docker build -f centos-7-Dockerfile -t ${IMAGE_NAME} .

Create docker volume, will print name as string, specify or randomly generate
$ docker volume create data_volume
data_volume
$ docker volume create

The difference between “docker run” and “docker exec” is that “docker exec” executes a command on a running container. On the other hand, “docker run” creates a temporary container, executes the command in it and stops the container when it is done.
