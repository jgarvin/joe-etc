  # mount unit, which overrules fstab. The reason itâ€™s overruled is
  # because NixOS puts those upstream units in /etc while
  # systemd-fstab-generator puts its fstab-derived units in /run, and
  # /etc overrules /run in systemd logic. Other distros put these
  # upstream mount units in /usr/lib, which /run overrules, so they
  # get the opposite behavior."
