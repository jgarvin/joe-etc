;;; Commentary:

;; ack.el provides a simple compilation mode for the perl grep-a-like
;; ack (http://petdance.com/ack/).

;; If `ack-guess-type' is non-nil and `ack-mode-type-map' has a
;; reasonable value then ack.el will try and guess what you would like
;; in the --type argument for ack.

;; To install/use put ack.el in your load-path and (require 'ack) in
;; your initialisation file. You can then M-x ack and you're off.
